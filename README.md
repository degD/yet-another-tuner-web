# YAT: YET ANOTHER TUNER

## Disclaimer: 
This is a personal project with the intend to learn how to build a Progressive Web App (PWA) and distribute it among different platforms.
It is not made as an end-user product, and it may contain bugs. Pitch detection is not very reliable as well. I will try to implement a 
better algorithm in the future. Use at your own risk.

## What is this application for?
This is a bare-bones tuner app written with the intend of being cross-platform. Because of the relative simplicity of this project, and 
generality of the web systems, I decided to build a PWA. I also considered using React Native, but unfortunately, it caused more headache than help. 
As an amateur musician, I always regretted not having a great but also open-source tuner app. I decided to build this app:
1. To learn how to design a UI
2. To find out some methods for better pitch detection

In this project, node package [pitchy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pitchy) has used for pitch detection, and [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/)
has used for building the project. [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) also used to generate simple icons and favicons.

## How to run?
Just head to the [GitHub Pages](https://degd.github.io/yet-another-tuner-web/) or download the builded PWA from the releases tab.
